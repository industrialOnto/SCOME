The dimension located at bottom right part of the figure, with yellow background, shows the classes that define the structure of a SC performance evaluation system. As seen, such system relies on at least two performance dimensions (e.g., an internal or cost related dimension, an external or customer related one and an equity dimension), which in turn are linked to performance concepts (e.g., Responsiveness, Agility, Reliability, Costs, Return on Assets, Profit Equity, etc.). Performance concepts abstract the key factors that are to be evaluated in a given supply chain dimension. The evaluation of a certain concept is not done directly, but by means of its associated performance attributes. 
The Performance attribute class, which specializes the Assessable Attribute one, as well as the Evaluation parameter, which is also specialized, along with other additional classes (Scale Value, Unit of Measure, Scale Type, etc.) comprise another dimension of SCOME, named Performance attributes and Evaluation parameters. This dimension is depicted at the upper right corner of Fig. 1, having a brown background.  
The measures of the performance attributes pertaining to a SC, or the measures of any of its components, are obtained through the execution of measurement activities that allow quantifying assessable attributes. These activities resort to the use of specifi methods, called metrics, which determine what is evaluated, when, and how. The classes Measure, Metric, and Assessment activiy, among others, are the main entities that comprise the Measurement methods and activities dimension that is depicted at the right hand side of Fig. 1, having a grey background.
