SCOME establishes the fundamental concepts needed to model a SC performance evaluation system in terms of performance dimensions, concepts and attributes in a formal fashion. It captures performance related concepts and activities, taking into account the need of clearly specifying measures (what is measured, when and where) and how something is evaluated by means of a formal metric.  The evaluation system proposed in SCOME focuses on measuring the performance of a supply chain as a whole by adopting a balanced and hierarchical system. However, due to the SC complexity, it is often necessary to measure the performance of specific SC components to determine the overall performance of the CS. For this reason, SCOME also represents elements for measuring the performance of entities such as enterprises, machines, and people, as well as organizational units, processes, among others.
