# SCOME
The Supply Chain (SC) measurement sub-ontology (SCOME) is a module of SCONTO (Supply Chain Ontology), which formally describes a supply chain based on the SCOR de facto standard [1]. SCOME aims at specifying a performance evaluation system in terms of the dimensions to be assessed and each dimension in terms of performance concepts – such as Responsiveness, Agility, Reliability, Costs, Return on Assets – to be evaluated. In turn, different performance attributes, like Average order fulfillment cycle time, Percentage of orders meeting delivery performance, etc., are associated with each performance concept. SCOME formally prescribes how the appraisal of any performance attribute is done by means of an assessment activity, which employs a calculation method, named metric, and which generates a measure.
